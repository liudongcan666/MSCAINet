# MSCAINet: Multi-scale Semantic Correlation and Affinity Inference Network for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification

This repository contains the implementation of **MSCAINet**, a method designed to improve visible-infrared person re-identification by effectively capturing multi-scale semantic correlations and affinity relationships between cross-modality features.

This paper is currently being extended for a journal submission, and the updated implementation will be released after the extension is completed.
